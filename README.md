### The Story 

We've been receiving an unsually large volume of orders in the `City Center` and after having discusions with our delivery team we've decided that it would be really usefull to them if they could `get` a list of all the `scooters` that are available in the `Center City`. Using cars for deliveries in the `City Center` would be too slow with all the traffic and congestion around lunch time.

The delivery team has also asked if we could provide them with a way to `add` more drivers to the list. This will allow them to allocate more drivers to specific areas as the demand increases.

### Requirements

We have provided `data.json` with a sample dataset that you will need to use build the project based on the following requirements.

- Build a RESTful web service with the necessary API endpoints
- Make use of some type of noSQL database

#### Optional

- Unit Tests
- Basic Frontend


<!-- TODO -->
<!-- 1. get all the `scooters`  at `Center City`
2. Add driver  -->
